Main hub will be defined as a set area but populated and created at runtime.
There will be a defined number of arms that come off the main hub
These arms will need to be procedural.
The arms should not bend too much so that they seem natural

an arm can be generated by a recursive backtracking algorithm creating points and then smoothing these points out with a curve and finally generating a mesh around them
